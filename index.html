            <h2>Who is it for?</h2>

            <p>Head Start is for families with kids from birth to age 5. We provide custom learning plans for your child. We offer half-day programs, full-day programs, and home-based services.</p>

            <p>One way to qualify is by meeting income limits.</p>

            <p>First, count the size of your family. For Head Start, a family means all the children in a home plus the adults that support them with their incomes.</p>
            
            <p>Next, add up the monthly income that the adults make before taxes are taken out. Find your family on the chart below.</p>
